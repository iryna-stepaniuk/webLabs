        <p>Joker is a 2019 American psychological thriller film directed by Todd Phillips, who co-wrote the screenplay
            with Scott Silver. The film, based on DC Comics characters, stars Joaquin Phoenix as the Joker. Distributed
            by Warner Bros. Pictures, it is intended to launch DC Black, a series of DC-based standalone films. The
            film, which acts as an origin story for the Joker, is set in 1981 and follows Arthur Fleck, a failed
            stand-up comedian who turns to a life of crime and chaos in Gotham City. Robert De Niro, Zazie Beetz,
            Frances Conroy, Brett Cullen, Marc Maron, Bill Camp, Shea Whigham, Glenn Fleshler, Douglas Hodge, and Brian
            Tyree Henry, among others, appear in supporting roles.

            Lion, the festival's highest prize. It is scheduled to be theatrically released in the United States on
            October 4, 2019. The film received positive reviews from critics, with particular praise for Phoenix's
