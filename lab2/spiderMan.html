        <p>Spider-Man: Far From Home is a 2019 American superhero film based on the Marvel Comics character Spider-Man,
            co-produced by Columbia Pictures and Marvel Studios, and distributed by Sony Pictures Releasing. It is the
            sequel to Spider-Man: Homecoming (2017) and the twenty-third film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU).
            The film is directed by Jon Watts, written by Chris McKenna and Erik Sommers, and stars Tom Holland as Peter
            Parker / Spider-Man, alongside Samuel L. Jackson, Zendaya, Cobie Smulders, Jon Favreau, J. B. Smoove, Jacob
            Batalon, Martin Starr, Marisa Tomei, and Jake Gyllenhaal. In Spider-Man: Far From Home, Parker is recruited
            by Nick Fury and Mysterio to face the Elementals while he is on a school trip to Europe.</p>
        <p>Cast:</p>
        <ul>
            <li> Tom Holland as Peter Parker / Spider-Man:
                A teenager and Avenger who received spider-like abilities after being bitten by a genetically-modified
                spider. Director Jon Watts said that in contrast to Spider-Man: Homecoming in which Parker longs for
                the responsibilities of an adult, in Far From Home, he wants to hang onto his youth.
            </li>
            <li> Samuel L. Jackson as Nick Fury:
                The former director of S.H.I.E.L.D. Watts describes Fury's relationship with Parker as "the mean new
                stepdad", contrasting his role with Tony Stark's "supportive cool uncle" in Homecoming, saying, "Fury
                doesn't see himself in Peter Parker.
